# Welcome to Atreugo contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code :sparkles:.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/savsgio/atreugo/issues?q=). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/savsgio/atreugo/issues?q=) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

Once your changes are ready, don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process:zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to link PR to issue you are solving one.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as **_resolved_**.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: Thanks you so much :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be available in the next release.

Now you are part of the Atreugo community :wink:.
